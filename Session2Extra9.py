# Challenging Problems # Session 2* Index of Fibonacci number

""" STATEMENT: Fibonocci numbers are defined as follows:
Zeroth Fibonacci number F(0) is equal 0
Second Fibonacci number F(1) is equal 1
Third Fibonacci number F(2) is equal F(0) + F(1) is equal 1
...
Nth Fibonacci number F(N) is equal F(N-1) + F(N-2)

Given an integer a, determine its index among the Fibonacci numbers, that is, print the number N
such that F(N)=a. If a is not a Fibonacci number, print -1.

For example on input: 10 output must be -1

TEMPLATE:

TESTS:
Input: 10 Output: -1
Input: 2 Output: 3
Input: 8 Output: 6
Input: 55 Output: 10 """
