# Session 2 Problem 08 Fibonacci Numbers

""" STATEMENT: Fibonocci numbers are defined as follows:
Zeroth Fibonacci number F(0) is equal 0
Second Fibonacci number F(1) is equal 1
Third Fibonacci number F(2) is equal F(0) + F(1) is equal 1
...
Nth Fibonacci number F(N) is equal F(N-1) + F(N-2)

Given a nonegative integer N, print the N-th Fibonacci number F(N)

For example, on input 4 output must be 3
